**RFID Warehouse Access Control System:**
This project implements an RFID-based access control system for managing access to different sections in a warehouse, along with basic inventory management. The system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller, a MFRC522 RFID reader, and a web interface to monitor and control warehouse sections based on authorized RFID tags.

**Key Features:**
RFID-based Access Control: Grants or denies access to warehouse sections based on authorized RFID tags.
Inventory Management: Displays a list of warehouse sections, items, and quantities on a web page.
Real-time Access Log: Shows the current status (granted or denied) for each section.
ESP32 Web Server: Hosts a local web server allowing easy access to the system via any device on the same network.
Relay Control: Simulates locking/unlocking a door to grant access to authorized personnel.
